# Rel-me

[rel-me](https://indieweb.org/rel-me) is a way to identify yourself as the same person on another website or service from your own domain.

Tanzawa allows you to register as many rel-me links as you'd like. All relme links will be listed in your `<head>` block of your website.

## Registering URLs

To register rel-me urls, open `/admin/indieweb/trelme/add/` or from the Dashboard click Settings -> Relme (located under Indieweb) -> Add Relme.
